# MLOPs-Face-Recognition-Using-MobileNet
I have created a face recognition model using transfer learning, which means, we use a pre trained model/architecture and their weights to customize the model according to our requirements. I used mobilenet model here. There are total 11 categories in the dataset, out of which 10 are of monkey breeds and the 11th one is that of my faces.  1132 images are used for training and 277 for validation. 
The model accuracy is around 95% and the best variable accuracy being approximately 97.5%.
